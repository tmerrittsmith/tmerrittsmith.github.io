I'm a Maths graduate, and worked as a Secondary School Maths teacher for 7 years before finally making the jump into Data Science.

Things I really enjoy:
- being a dad
- playing guitar
- writing unpythonic one-liners (think nested dictionary comprehensions)
- ruining games with maths (markov decision processes, mcts, etc. et.)

Things I'm interested in:
- Topic modelling
- NLP (especially short text documents)
- Probabilistic graphical models
- Using pytorch
- Data feminism
- Open data, but also finding the signal in the noise
